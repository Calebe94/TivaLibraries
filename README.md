# TivaLibraries

This repository is being developed by [Calebe94](https://github.com/Calebe94) and [arturgoms](https://github.com/arturgoms).

Tiva Libraries is written in C and it's meant to be used as a reference. But you can use it as your main framework if you want to.

The folders in the root directory of this repository is structured as follows:

    README.md
    LICENCE
    peripheral/
        resources/
            images/
            ...
        code/
        examples/
        initialization.md
    ...


Every peripheral is enabled with Direct Access to Low Level Registers, so binary operations and intermediate C programming knowledge is highly recommended.
